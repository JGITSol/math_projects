## tl;dr
- **Derivative (Slope)**: How steep the hill is right now.
- **Integral (Area)**: How much distance you've covered.
- **Relationship**: Speed is the Derivative of Position. Distance is the Integral of Speed.
- **Interactive**: Drag the sliders to see slopes change in real-time.

## 1. The Slope (Derivative) 🎢
Imagine you are driving a car on a hilly road.
- **The Function** is the shape of the road.
- **The Derivative** is how steep the road is under your tires.
    - Steep up? Positive Slope.
    - Flat peak? Zero Slope.
    - Steep down? Negative Slope.

In engineering, this tells us **Velocity** (how fast position changes) or **Heat Flow** (how fast temperature changes).

## 2. The Area (Integral) 🧱
Imagine you are building a wall, brick by brick.
- **The Function** is the height of each brick you add.
- **The Integral** is the total area of the wall you've built so far.

In engineering, this tells us **Total Energy**, **Total Distance**, or **Total Stress**.

## 3. Why learn both?
Because everything in the universe is either *changing* (Derivatives) or *accumulating* (Integrals).
- **Navigation**: GPS uses integrals to calculate position from speed.
- **AI Training**: AI uses derivatives to "slide down" error mountains (Project 3).
