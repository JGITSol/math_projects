# Statics: The Science of Standing Still

## Equilibrium Conditions
For a structure (like a bridge or building) to stand still, two conditions must be met:
1. **Sum of Forces Zero**: $\Sigma F = 0$. Net force is zero, so it doesn't translate (slide).
   - $\Sigma F_x = 0$ (Left = Right)
   - $\Sigma F_y = 0$ (Up = Down)
2. **Sum of Moments Zero**: $\Sigma M = 0$. Net twisting force (torque) is zero, so it doesn't rotate.

## Concepts
- **Resultant ($R$)**: The single force that could replace all other forces combined. If $R \neq 0$, the object accelerates.
- **Moment ($M$)**: The tendency of a force to rotate an object. $M = F \cdot d$, where $d$ is the perpendicular distance (lever arm).
- **Free Body Diagram**: A simplified sketch showing all forces acting on an object.

## Engineering Applications
- **Civil Engineering**: Designing bridges so they don't collapse under load.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Ensuring gears and shafts don't snap under torque.
- **Aerodynamics**: Balancing Lift, Weight, Thrust, and Drag for steady flight.
